"""Recipe for training a speaker-id system. The template can use used as a
basic example for any signal classification task such as language_id,
emotion recognition, command classification, etc. The proposed task classifies
28 speakers using Mini Librispeech. This task is very easy. In a real
scenario, you need to use datasets with a larger number of speakers such as
the voxceleb one (see recipes/VoxCeleb). Speechbrain has already some built-in
models for signal classifications (see the ECAPA one in
speechbrain.lobes.models.ECAPA_TDNN.py or the xvector in
speechbrain/lobes/models/Xvector.py)

To run this recipe, do the following:
> python train.py train.yaml

To read the code, first scroll to the bottom to see the "main" code.
This gives a high-level overview of what is going on, while the
Brain class definition provides the details of what happens
for each batch during training.

The first time you run it, this script should automatically download
and prepare the Mini Librispeech dataset for computation. Noise and
reverberation are automatically added to each sample from OpenRIR.
